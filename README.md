### Become is a POKeMON FireRed hack that forces the player to stay behind from the POKeMON adventure due to their gender, or lackthereof. 

#### What is a normal gender?

#### Is it being binary? Is that the only requirement?

#### How have we gotten caught up on this conception of binary?

#### Perhaps it is more important to consider gender for what *it is*, not what *it is not*.
