# RepresentMe

### RepresentMe is a POKeMON FireRed hack that forces the player to stay behind from the POKeMON adventure due to their gender, or lackthereof. 

#### Within the game, the player starts off just as any player would: by choosing their gender and name. 

#### After doing so and beginning their "adventure" in the world of POKeMON, the player is seen as someone without the gender they assigned themselves in the beginning of the game, which causes them trouble.
