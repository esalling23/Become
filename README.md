# Become

### Become is a POKeMON FireRed hack that forces the player to stay behind from the POKeMON adventure due to their gender, or lackthereof. 

#### At the start of the game, the player skips the gender choice, but is allowed to identify themselves by their name. 

#### Within the game, the player first discovers that they are not allowed to leave their room immediately, because they didn't pick a binary gender identity. 

#### After doing research on their non-binary gender identity options, they are allowed to leave their room and speak to their binary parents. 

#### The parents give the player their starter POKeMON - a Ditto (lvl 1) - and sends the player on their way with the knowledge that they are not following the normal narrative.
